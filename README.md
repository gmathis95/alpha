# Alpha
The Alpha framework will be a PHP framework that ships with its own visual IDE, it is going to take a different approach on the way things are built and will be great for new developers and designers alike. The goal behind this project is to provide a sleek environment to visually drag and drop elements onto a web page, while still giving experienced developers the tools needed to build anything their hearts desire.

# Alpha Framework Development
It's easy to start working on the Alpha framework, if there are any features you might find you need, you can edit the source files and create a pull request so we can review your code and hopefully add it to the next release. This project is written with the Electron framework, so setting up a development environment is as easy as running 3 commands.

```bash
# Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/gmathis95/alpha

# Installing the dependancies
npm install

# Running the Alpha IDE
npm run
```
As you can see, this is a very simple setup and it shouldn't take very long to get started. We try to keep the code in a state that's easy to understand because the easier it is to understand the code, the easier it will be to maintain it.

# Planned Features (It would be nice to get some help)
1. Drag and Drop Editor that exports the attributes to JSON format.
2. A tool to parse the JSON save files back into something visual
3. A code editor that will allow developers to create their own Modules (or what Alpha will call them, prefabs)
